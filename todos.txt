- macros
- namespaces
- sequences
- boolean basic operators
- compare to clojure basic read types
- Better error messages
- mutation / while loop
- lazy evaluation (want infinite lists, etc..)
- continuations (want a call/cc structure)
- objects/type system/define-type?
- add toWispString() to objects (for closure printing, etc..)
- Garbage collection & memory usage -> reason about this. Gut inclination is currently implementation eats up memory. Maybe JS takes care of this?
- Exception Handling
- Access to Dom? Perhaps can drop down to jquery, or at least use jquery selectors natively e.g. (append ("#mydiv") "wicked"). Or something.
